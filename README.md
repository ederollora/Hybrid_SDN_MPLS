# Hybrid SDN MPLS networks

Repository that holds the code for "Toward monitoring hybrid next-generation software-defined and service provider MPLS networks" published at Computer Networks in Elsevier.


## Resources

This description might become more detailed but you can find the P4<sub>14</sub> code for the Netronome and the the P4<sub>16</sub> code for the Wedge switch. You can also find a partial implementation for the minimal LDP required by the Cisco switches running in the GNS3 as well as the ARP responder code. You can also find all the scripts to craft custom packets and the receiver scripts.
